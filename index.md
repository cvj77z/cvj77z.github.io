### AI Writing · Prompt Engineering · Nuanced LLM Evaluation

I specialize in understanding how people communicate—and where AI systems misunderstand them.
My work focuses on subtle failure modes such as **sycophancy**, **undesirable compliance**, 
**implicit intent**, **subtle bias**, and **sociolinguistic misalignment**, drawing on a background 
in anthropology and close analysis of tone, context, and human communication patterns.

This portfolio highlights my work across four core areas:

- **Prompt Engineering:** multi-step instruction systems for classification, reasoning, metadata 
  extraction, and domain-specific workflows.
- **Nuanced Data Labeling:** tasks requiring human judgment, including implicit intent detection,
  hidden requests, politeness strategies, coded hostility, and subtle bias.
- **Safety & Model Stress Testing:** evaluation frameworks for hallucination, undesirable 
  compliance (incorrect or unsafe agreement), ambiguous risk, clarity under pressure, and other 
  behavioral weaknesses.
- **Applied Sociolinguistics:** tools for analyzing and modeling register, tone, politeness, 
  power dynamics, and code-switching—areas where LLMs often misread human nuance.

I am currently conducting a **multi-model sycophancy study**, comparing how different LLMs respond
to incorrect or harmful premises under varying forms of conversational pressure.
