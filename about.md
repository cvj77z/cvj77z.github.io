# About

I’m Caroline V. James, a writer and evaluator specializing in the intersection of language, 
culture, and AI behavior. My background in anthropology informs how I analyze not just what people 
say, but how they say it—the tone, idioms, slang, cultural cues, and pragmatic signals that shape 
meaning. These are the areas where AI systems most often misinterpret human communication.

I work on:

- designing prompt systems for classification, reasoning, and domain-specific workflows  
- evaluating model behavior for clarity, correctness, safety risk, and undesirable compliance  
- developing taxonomies and labeling frameworks for subtle or ambiguous language  
- analyzing tone, politeness, register, power dynamics, idiomatic usage, and cultural context  
- identifying failure modes such as sycophancy, subtle bias, and misinterpretation of intent  
- creating structured datasets, annotations, and evaluation protocols  

I am especially interested in how LLMs handle culturally grounded expression—how meaning shifts 
with idioms, indirectness, politeness strategies, and the unspoken assumptions shared within 
communities. My goal is to help build AI systems that are more truthful, context-aware, and 
aligned with real human communication.
